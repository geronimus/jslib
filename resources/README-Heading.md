# `@geronimus/jslib`

A modular set of utility functions for JavaScript.

Nothing here is rocket science. The intent is to provide some basic functionality that it would be handy not to have to re-implement in every project.

Each is intended to be published to the package manager independently, so that a user will only have to depend on the functions they end up using.
